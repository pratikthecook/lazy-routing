# Dynamic Lazy Routing from a service.
(Deprecated as Implemented on Angular2 Beta 9 Version, and now this is provided out of the box)
Using Angular2 Routing to lazy load routes from a Service.

Routes are pretty much hard coded, but this example shows pure dynamic nature of routes loaded to the application and request 
to the component is made only when the link for route is clicked.

Issue : Cannot re-use the RouteDefinition Array.
